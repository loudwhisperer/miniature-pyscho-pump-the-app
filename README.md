## Description
Miniature Pyscho Pump The App gives users a basic text editor experience that rivals that of notepad 2.0 (except you can't really code in it) you can code in it without any of the worry of pesky helper bots and plugins bothering you or telling you your code is wrong. You can write simple notes to yourself to look book on wherever you go and best of all you can download it to your local storage so you have your nots always handy without the internet.
